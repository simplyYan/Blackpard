Blackpard is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on speed, security and flexibility. Blackpard's goal is to be flexible, and compatible with any device on most operating systems. Currently, our language is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS. The Blackpard language is mostly used for the back-end, but it has quality front-end frameworks.

## How to install
- macOS and Linux:
1. Download the dependencies using `curl`:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/bpcompiler.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/SRC/linux/blackpard_src.sh
```
*To download Blackpard you must be in the terminal's home directory

2. The installation is complete. You can now start using Blackpard. For instructions on how to use it, refer to the documentation.
- Windows:
To install Blackpard for Windows, the process is a little different, and requires an extra dependency. You'll need Cygwin to run Blackpard code.
Here are the steps:
1. install Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/install.html)

2. In the standard Windows terminal, download Blackpard using the commands:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/compiler.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/SRC/linux/blackpard_src.sh
```
*To download Blackpard you must be in the terminal's home directory

3. That's it. You can now use Blackpard, but it will only work in the Cygwin terminal. Commands and code must always be run in Cygwin, including running Blackpard code using "bpcompiler".

- Android:
Blackpard is also compatible with Android, but it's still in the testing phase. You can use Termux for this. You can download the original version of Termux from bpardDep. Here's the step-by-step guide:

1. Download Termux from bpardDep by [clicking here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vd9SL-mHOZTRyFEqJuAFV3nAEAXSYJpo?usp=sharing).

2. Download Blackpard in the Termux terminal using the command:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/compiler.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/Blackpard/main/SRC/linux/blackpard_src.sh
```

3. That's it! You can now use Blackpard through Termux.

Note: Termux is not an app developed by me, and the version provided is original and free.
