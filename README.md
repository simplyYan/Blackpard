## Using the compiler
Using the compiler is simple. It has only 2 commands, and each command accepts only one argument, which in both cases is a .blpd file (a Blackpard script). See:

1. run: Run/test a Blackpard file.
- Example:
```bash
run ./test.blpd
```
2. compile: Compiles a Blackpard file, and makes it "sticky", i.e. your compiler will be an automatic connector, which when opened will execute the defined file automatically. This can be used by the end client or by you to distribute your app.
- Example:
```bash
compile ./test.blpd
```
3. (SPECIAL) del: Uninstalls the compiled file, and makes the compiler free again. Does not accept arguments.
