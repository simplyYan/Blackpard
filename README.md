Blackpard is a high-level compiled language that is fast, light, easy, secure and broad.

## How to install
Blackpard can be installed using weepsbox, a tool I developed to install and run small, single-file Python packages. First, look at the requirements:

- Python >= 3.8.12

- Windows, Linux or macOS versions released after 2017

- wget and curl

Now, if you have the requirements, just use a command in the terminal to install. The command is different for Windows, Linux and macOS. Check it out:

- Windows (Powershell only):
```
powershell -command "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/weepsbox/main/win.weepsbox.bat', 'win.weepsbox.bat')"
win.weepsbox.bat
```
- Linux:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/weepsbox/main/lin.weepsbox.sh
chmod 777 lin.weepsbox.sh
./lin.weepsbox.sh
```
- macOS:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplyYan/weepsbox/main/mac.weepsbox.sh
chmod 777 lin.weepsbox.sh
./mac.weepsbox.sh
```

- In-house compiler: The magic behind Blackpard is also due to the efficient and modern compiler.
